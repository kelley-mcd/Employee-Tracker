# Employee-Tracker
this project encompasses a few different methods we have used thus far.

we will install mysql, express, and sequelize to complete this project.

When the user gets prompted, they will be able to choose from a list of items as to what they would like to do.
They can either edit the employees information or add on to the existing information that is already there. 
Some of the information about the employees that is already in the tables are the employees position, department they work in, salary, and employee id.
